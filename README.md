# Financial Tracker

A local-first personal expense tracker for Windows, built with Electron, React,
TypeScript, and SQLite. The app opens to a collapsible sidebar with Overview,
Transactions, Accounts, and Settings pages. On start you pick or create a
profile; each profile has its own SQLite database and data folder. Financial
data is not implemented yet.

## Requirements

- Windows (x64 or ARM64)
- Node.js 24.x (the development machine runs 24.15.0); see `.nvmrc`
- npm 12.2.0 or newer (upgrade Node's bundled npm with
  `npm install --global npm@12.2.0`)

## Setup

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Dependencies are pinned exactly. `better-sqlite3` 13 ships Windows binaries using
the stable Node-API 10 ABI, so no Electron-specific rebuild is needed. There is
one dependency installation, and `npm test` verifies SQLite using Electron's Node
runtime (`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`). This avoids the native ABI mismatch of older
`better-sqlite3` versions without separate Node and Electron installations.

Install requires npm 12.2.0 or newer, enforced by `.npmrc`'s `engine-strict`.
npm loses SQLite's `gypfile: false` metadata in lockfiles and incorrectly invokes
node-gyp during clean installation. Previously `ignore-scripts=true` avoided that
bug but also prevented Husky's `prepare` script from installing Git hooks.
Instead, npm 12's `allowScripts` policy in `package.json` explicitly denies
dependency scripts for SQLite, Electron, and esbuild, while allowing the root
`prepare` script to install hooks automatically on `npm install` and `npm ci`.
SQLite includes its native binary, Electron 44 downloads its executable on first
`dev` or `test`, and esbuild uses its platform-specific optional dependency.
`strict-allow-scripts=true` rejects unreviewed dependency scripts; review this
policy whenever dependencies change. Do not restore `ignore-scripts=true` or
install with `--ignore-scripts`: either would skip hook installation. Run
`npm run prepare` to repair hooks after an intentionally script-free install.

| `npm run guard -- <files...>` | Check listed files for personal data, invalid JSON, merge markers, and size.      |

## Local quality gates

Husky and lint-staged are exact-pinned development dependencies. After installation
in a Git clone, `git config --get core.hooksPath` should print `.husky/_`.

- **pre-commit** runs on added/copied/modified/renamed staged files. lint-staged
  hides unstaged edits, runs the file guard, ESLint on JavaScript/TypeScript files,
  then Prettier's check on supported files. Failures abort the commit and restore
  the index and unstaged edits. Formatting is not silently changed: use
  `npm run format`, inspect the diff, and stage the fix. Existing Prettier ignore
  rules apply (including the generated lockfile).
- The file guard blocks Windows home-directory paths (backslash, escaped
  backslash, forward slash, and Git Bash forms), GitHub tokens, AWS access key
  identifiers, private-key headers, common secret assignments, and e-mail
  addresses except GitHub noreply addresses. It also rejects images in any
  `fixtures/` directory (common extensions and image signatures), invalid `.json`
  files, merge-conflict markers, and files larger than **1,000,000 bytes**.
  Diagnostics identify the file, line, and rule without echoing matched content.
- **pre-push** runs `npm run typecheck` and then `npm test` against the working
  tree; either failure aborts the push.

The guard is also usable outside hooks, for example
`npm run guard -- README.md package.json`. Pass filenames as separate arguments
(quote filenames containing spaces), relative to the repository root or absolute.
Deleted files in a diff are skipped. No arguments or an unreadable/malformed
configuration exits with code 2; findings exit with code 1; clean files exit 0.
The guard's CLI tests run as part of `npm test`.

### Personal-data false positives

Never allow real personal data or credentials. Prefer rewriting a false positive
first. For unavoidable synthetic examples, add a reviewed entry to
`.personal-data-allowlist.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "file": "path/to/synthetic-example.txt",
    "rule": "email",
    "sha256": "<SHA-256 of complete file bytes>",
    "reason": "Why this specific synthetic example must be kept"
  }
]
```

Use an exact repository-relative path with forward slashes, one of
`windows-home`, `secret`, `email`, or `fixture-image`, a lowercase SHA-256 digest,
and a nonempty reason. Compute the digest without copying matched content into
the allowlist:

```sh
node --input-type=module -e "import {createHash} from 'node:crypto'; import {readFileSync} from 'node:fs'; console.log(createHash('sha256').update(readFileSync(process.argv[1])).digest('hex'))" path/to/synthetic-example.txt
```

An entry exempts only that rule for that exact file content. Any file change
revokes it; there are no wildcard or blanket file exemptions. JSON, merge-marker,
and size checks cannot be allowlisted. Stage the reviewed allowlist with the file
so hooks and a later CI diff scan see the same approval. Hooks are a local safety
net, not a substitute for review or CI: Git's `--no-verify` and `HUSKY=0` can bypass
them, and pattern matching cannot detect every possible form of sensitive data.

The renderer has no Node access; a sandboxed, isolated preload exposes only the
typed app diagnostics and profile operations (including settings). SQLite is
used only in the main process.
Profiles are listed in `profiles.json` under the app's user-data folder; each
profile lives in `profiles/<id>/` (database, data folder, pre-migration
backups). Migrations are forward-only and run after a verified backup; a
database with a newer schema is refused. Installer packaging is not included yet.

## Continuous integration

Every pull request (regardless of its base branch) and every push to `main` runs
the `checks` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on `windows-latest`. CI reads Node
from `.nvmrc`, installs npm 12.2.0, and runs `npm ci`, the changed-file guard,
lint, formatting checks, typechecking, tests, and the build. If a diff base is
unavailable (including the first push), the guard scans all tracked files instead.
New PR runs cancel older runs for the same PR. The stable required check name
for the `main` ruleset is `checks`.

## App shell

- The shell uses Tailwind CSS 4 via its Vite plugin, lucide icons, and the
  [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) Button, Card, and Native Select components,
  adapted to the shell's needs. Their MIT license is included alongside the
  components in `src/renderer/src/components/ui/LICENSE`.
- Visual tokens live in `src/renderer/src/tokens.css`: calm green/teal accent,
  light and dark surfaces, radius, and density (the Tailwind spacing unit).
- Settings saves language (HU/EN/DE), appearance (light/dark/system), and base
  currency (HUF/CHF) in each profile's SQLite database. English, the system theme,
  and HUF are the initial defaults, including for existing profiles upgraded from
  the identity-only schema. Saved choices apply immediately and return when the
  profile is opened again; switching profiles switches its language and theme.
  Failed saves show a translated error and leave the previous choices applied.
  Base currency is stored for later reports; currency conversion is not included.
- The system theme follows Windows through `prefers-color-scheme`, using
  Electron's default system `nativeTheme`. Explicit light/dark modes override
  that preference in the renderer, including native form controls.
- A small typed i18n module uses HU/EN/DE catalogs in
  `src/renderer/src/i18n/`, without a runtime library. `createFormatters` uses
  `Intl` with `hu-HU`, `en-GB`, and `de-DE` for dates and numbers. The
  completeness test checks the union of catalog keys, so a missing key in any
  language fails; TypeScript also checks Hungarian and German against English.
- The profile area at the bottom of the sidebar shows the active profile and
  switches profiles. The other financial pages are placeholders.

### Manual shell check

Run `npm run dev`, navigate all four pages, and collapse/expand the sidebar.
In Settings, select each language and verify labels and formatting change live.
Select HUF and CHF as the base currency. Create a second profile with a different
language, theme, and base currency; switch between the profiles and restart the
app to verify that each profile restores its own choices.
Select Light and Dark, then Follow Windows; while following Windows, change
Windows' app color mode and verify the shell follows it. Explicit Light/Dark
must stay unchanged when Windows changes. Check keyboard navigation and focus
indicators with both sidebar sizes. UI behavior is checked manually, not by the
automated test suite.
